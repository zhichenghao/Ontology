## What is Ontology

As a branch of philosophy, ontology is the science of what is, the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area in reality. Ontology include set of **concepts** and **relations**. It is knowledge about general propositions that are true of concepts. It means that ontology not concerned with indiviudal things (such as hotels, room) rather than focusing on the definitions of concepts. It is usually resulting in computer implementation. Ontology can be defined informally or using ideas from set theory and logic.

Ontology is useful because it can be used to communicated between **people**. Technical terms are often used with different meaning by different groups in an organization, e.g."Supplier". Ontology can be used to communicated between **computers**. e.g. &lt;cost&gt;£10&lt;/cost&gt; v.s. &lt;price&gt;£10&lt;price&gt;.
